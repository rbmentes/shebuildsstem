  <h2>Part 1 — What Is MFCC and Why Is It Used in Speech Processing?</h2>

  <p><strong>February 2026</strong></p>

  <p>
  When we record audio, what we actually get is a long sequence of numbers.
  These numbers represent air pressure changes over time.
  </p>

  <p>
  Raw audio is often too detailed and noisy for machine learning models.
  That’s why we use feature extraction.
  </p>

  <h3>What Is MFCC?</h3>

  <p>
  MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) is a compact representation
  of audio that mimics human hearing.
  </p>

  <p>
  Instead of using raw waveform samples, we extract meaningful frequency-based features.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Is MFCC Important?</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Reduces data size</li>
    <li>Keeps important speech characteristics</li>
    <li>Widely used before deep learning became dominant</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>

  <p>
  MFCC relies on handcrafted feature engineering and may miss complex
  patterns that deep learning models can learn automatically.
