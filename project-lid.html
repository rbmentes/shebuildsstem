    <h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project was developed as part of my 
      <b>Introduction to Speech Processing</b> course.
      The goal was to build a system that can automatically recognize 
      the spoken language from short audio recordings.
    </p>

    <h2>🗂 Dataset</h2>
    <p>
      I used an open dataset from <b>Kaggle</b>, containing audio samples
      in multiple languages for training and evaluation.
    </p>

    <h2>⚙️ Methods Implemented</h2>

    <h3>1) MFCC-Based Classical Approach 🎼</h3>
    <p>
      My first implementation used <b>MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)</b>,
      which is a traditional and widely used feature extraction technique in speech processing.
      This approach helped me understand the foundations of audio analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was easier to implement, the accuracy was limited because MFCC-based
      pipelines are considered more classical compared to modern deep learning models.
    </p>

    <h3>2) CNN-Based Deep Learning Approach 🧠</h3>
    <p>
      After gaining confidence, I moved to a more modern method:
      <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b>.
      This model achieved significantly better results by learning patterns directly
      from audio representations.
    </p>

    <h2>🚧 Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      The most difficult part was improving the validation accuracy.
      I spent a lot of time analyzing what factors in the code were limiting performance
      and experimenting with changes to achieve better results.
    </p>

    <h2>✨ What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How to build real machine learning projects in <b>Python</b></li>
      <li>Using <b>Google Colab</b> efficiently for training deep models</li>
      <li>Audio preprocessing and feature extraction</li>
      <li>Speech processing is challenging, but also incredibly fun</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📊 Results</h2>
    <p>
      Below are sample outputs from the CNN method:
