  <h2>🎧 Speech AI Starter Series — Part 2</h2>
  <h3>CNNs for Speech Recognition</h3>

  <p>
    In Part 1, we learned why raw audio is not directly suitable for machine learning models 
    and why we use feature extraction methods like MFCC.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we move to something more powerful: <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong>.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>🧠 Why Do We Need Neural Networks for Speech?</h3>

  <p>
    Traditional machine learning models rely heavily on handcrafted features.
    But speech is complex. It contains patterns across time and frequency that are 
    difficult to manually design features for.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where deep learning comes in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of manually defining what is important, neural networks learn the patterns directly from data.
  </p>

  <h3>📊 Turning Audio into an Image</h3>

  <p>
    CNNs were originally designed for image processing.
    So how can we use them for speech?
  </p>

  <p>
    The trick is simple:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Convert audio into a spectrogram</li>
    <li>Represent it as a 2D matrix (time × frequency)</li>
    <li>Treat it like an image</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A spectrogram shows how frequency content changes over time.
    It visually represents speech patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now a CNN can scan this "image" and detect patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>🔍 How CNN Works on Speech</h3>

  <p>
    A Convolutional Neural Network consists of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Convolution layers</strong> → detect local patterns</li>
    <li><strong>Activation functions</strong> → introduce non-linearity</li>
    <li><strong>Pooling layers</strong> → reduce dimensionality</li>
    <li><strong>Fully connected layers</strong> → perform classification</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In speech tasks, convolution filters learn:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Frequency transitions</li>
    <li>Energy concentration patterns</li>
    <li>Phoneme-related structures</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Instead of manually extracting features like MFCC, 
    CNN automatically learns discriminative patterns.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h3>⚙️ Why CNNs Work Well for Speech</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Capture local frequency-time patterns</li>
    <li>Handle noise better than traditional methods</li>
    <li>Require less manual feature engineering</li>
    <li>Scale well with larger datasets</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    That’s why CNN-based models often outperform classical ML approaches in:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Speech recognition</li>
    <li>Language identification</li>
    <li>Speaker recognition</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h3>🧩 CNN vs MFCC — What’s the Difference?</h3>

  <p>
    MFCC is a handcrafted feature extraction method.
    CNN is a learning-based pattern extraction method.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many modern systems combine both:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Extract MFCC features</li>
    <li>Feed them into a CNN model</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This hybrid approach is very common in practical speech AI systems.

  <h3>🚀 What Comes Next?</h3>

  <p>
    In the next part, we will explore:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is a spectrogram in detail?</li>
    <li>How convolution actually works mathematically</li>
    <li>How to build a simple CNN for speech classification</li>
