  <h2>When You Feel Behind in Engineering...</h2>
  <p class="date">February 2026</p>

  <p>
    For a long time as an engineering student, I’ve carried a quiet feeling:
    the feeling of being behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not just “a little behind”… but a feeling that follows you
    even after class ends — into your social life,
    your silent moments, and the way you see yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes it feels like I need to work twice as hard
    to understand things others grasp immediately.
    I rewrite notes. I study for hours.
    I repeat the same topics again and again.
    And still… some things don’t click.
  </p>

  <h3>💗 Retaking a Course Is Not Failure</h3>

  <p>
    One of the hardest parts of my journey was retaking some courses.
    It made me feel inadequate.
    As if I would never be good enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Movies show the “smart engineer” who understands everything instantly.
    But real life is not like that.
  </p>

  <h3>⚡ Electrical Courses Were My Biggest Challenge</h3>

  <p>
    For me, electrical and circuit courses were the most difficult.
    Labs, problem-solving, building circuits…
    It wasn’t easy.
    Honestly, it’s still not fully easy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Retaking those courses hurt my confidence deeply.
    I felt like I was failing.
  </p>

  <h3>🌷 But Something Changed</h3>

  <p>
    Even in my hardest courses, something shifted.
    I began enjoying certain parts.
    Working on electronics projects started to excite me.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I had elective choices,
    I chose courses in these areas.
    Because despite the difficulty,
    there was still curiosity inside me.
  </p>

  <h3>✨ Comparison Is a Trap</h3>

  <p>
    I compare myself to others.
    “They’re ahead, I’m behind.”
    But engineering is not about being perfect.
    It’s about continuing.
  </p>

  <h3>💗 Feeling Behind Is Not the End</h3>

    <li>⚡ You are not incapable.</li>
    <li>🌷 You are still growing.</li>
