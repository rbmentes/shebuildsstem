  <h2>🎧 AI & Signal Processing Essentials — Part 1</h2>
  <h3>What Is Overfitting? (And Why It Happens)</h3>

  <p>
    When we train a machine learning model, we want it to learn patterns — not memorize data.
    Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise.
  </p>

  <h3>🧠 Simple Intuition</h3>
  <p>
    Imagine memorizing past exam questions perfectly. You score well on the same questions,
    but struggle when the questions change slightly. That is overfitting.
  </p>

  <h3>📊 Training vs Test Performance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Training accuracy → very high</li>
    <li>Validation/Test accuracy → significantly lower</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔬 Technical View</h3>
  <p>
    Overfitting occurs when a model has too much capacity relative to the dataset size.
    Deep networks can start fitting noise instead of meaningful patterns.
  </p>

  <h3>⚡ Why Does It Happen?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Model too complex</li>
    <li>Dataset too small</li>
    <li>Training too long</li>
    <li>No regularization</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎧 Overfitting in Speech AI</h3>
  <p>
    In speech tasks like deepfake detection, overfitting may appear as very high training accuracy
    but much lower validation accuracy.
  </p>

  <h3>🛠 How to Prevent It</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>More data</li>
    <li>Dropout & L2 regularization</li>
    <li>Early stopping</li>
    <li>Data augmentation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🔌 EE Perspective</h3>
  <p>
    From an Electrical Engineering perspective, a system must generalize to variations.
    AI models are no different.
  </p>

  <h3>💡 Final Takeaway</h3>
  <p>
    The goal is not to make the model memorize everything, but to make it learn what matters.
