      <h2>When You Feel Behind in Engineering…</h2>
      <p><i>Posted February 2026</i></p>

      <p>
        There’s a feeling I’ve carried for a long time as an engineering student:
        the feeling of being behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not just “a little behind,” but the kind of behind that follows you even after class ends.
        The kind that shows up in your social life, in quiet moments, and in the way you look at yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes I feel like I have to work twice as hard just to understand what others seem to grasp immediately.
        I take notes again and again. I study for hours. I repeat the same topics.
        And still… some lessons don’t click.
      </p>

      <h3>💗 Retaking Classes Doesn’t Mean You Failed</h3>
      <p>
        One of the hardest parts of my journey has been having to take some courses more than once.
        It made me feel like I wasn’t capable. Like I would never succeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Movies make it look like the “smart engineer” understands everything instantly.
        But real life isn’t like that.
      </p>

      <h3>⚡ Electrical Courses Were My Biggest Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        For me, the hardest part has been electrical circuit courses.
        Labs, problem solving, building circuits… it wasn’t easy.
        Honestly, it still isn’t.
      </p>

      <h3>🌷 But Somehow… I Started to Enjoy It</h3>
      <p>
        Even though those subjects were the hardest, something surprising happened:
        I started enjoying electronics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trying to build projects — even when I wasn’t perfect — felt exciting.
        And when I had the chance to choose electives, I found myself choosing those topics again.
      </p>

      <h3>✨ Comparison Is a Trap I Still Fall Into</h3>
      <p>
        I compare myself to others. Not just to men, but to everyone.
        I look around and think: “They’re ahead. They’re better. I’m late.”
      </p>

      <h3>💌 Feeling Behind Isn’t the End</h3>
      <p>
        Engineering is not about being perfect.
        It’s about continuing — even when it’s hard.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you feel behind, I want you to hear this:
      </p>

      <p>
        💗 You are not alone.<br>
        ⚡ You are not incapable.<br>
        🌷 You are still becoming.
