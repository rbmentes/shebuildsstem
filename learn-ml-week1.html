  <h2>Week 1 — What Is Machine Learning?</h2>

  <p class="date">Spring 2026</p>

  <h3>📌 Why I’m Starting This Series</h3>
  <p>
    This semester, I’m taking Machine Learning for the first time.
    Instead of just studying for exams, I decided to document what I learn —
    step by step.
  </p>

  <p>
    This series is not written as an expert.
    It’s written as an engineering student building understanding from the ground up.
  </p>

  <h3>🧠 What Is Machine Learning?</h3>

  <p>
    Machine Learning (ML) is a field of study that gives computers
    the ability to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of writing rules manually, we provide:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Data</li>
    <li>Examples</li>
    <li>Expected outputs (sometimes)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And the model learns the relationship.
  </p>

  <h3>🔍 Types of Machine Learning</h3>

  <h4>1️⃣ Supervised Learning</h4>
  <p>
    The model learns from labeled data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
    Predicting house prices (regression) or detecting fake voices (classification).
  </p>

  <h4>2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning</h4>
  <p>
    The model finds structure in unlabeled data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Example:
    Clustering similar audio samples.
  </p>

  <h4>3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning</h4>
  <p>
    The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards.
  </p>

  <h3>📊 Regression vs Classification</h3>

  <p>
    In supervised learning, two main tasks appear:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Regression</strong> → Output is continuous (e.g., price, temperature).</li>
    <li><strong>Classification</strong> → Output is categorical (e.g., real/fake).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In my deepfake detection project, I worked on classification.
  </p>

  <h3>📂 Dataset, Features, and Labels</h3>

  <p>
    A dataset usually consists of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Features (X)</strong> → Input variables</li>
    <li><strong>Labels (y)</strong> → Target outputs</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In speech processing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Features → MFCCs, spectrogram values</li>
    <li>Label → Real or Fake</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎯 Training vs Test Set</h3>

  <p>
    We split data into:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Training set → Model learns from this</li>
    <li>Test set → Model is evaluated on this</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This helps us measure generalization —
    the ability to perform well on unseen data.
  </p>

  <h3>⚡ Why Generalization Matters</h3>

  <p>
    A model that memorizes training data but fails on new data
    is not useful.
  </p>

  <p>
    This connects directly to overfitting —
    a concept I explained in my previous series.
  </p>

  <h3>💡 What I Realized This Week</h3>

  <p>
    Machine Learning is not magic.
    It is structured pattern recognition powered by mathematics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Understanding the vocabulary is the first step.
